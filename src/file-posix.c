 * mm_open() - Open file
 * @path:       path to file to open
 * @oflag:      control flags how to open the file
 * @mode:       access permission bits is file is created
 *
 * This function creates an open file description that refers to a file and
 * a file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file
 * descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file. The
 * @path argument points to a pathname naming the file.
 *
 * The file status flags and file access modes of the open file description
 * are set according to the value of @oflag, which is constructed by a
 * bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list. It must specify
 * exactly one of the first 3 values.
 *
 * %O_RDONLY
 *   Open for reading only.
 * %O_WRONLY
 *   Open for writing only.
 * %O_RDWR
 *   Open for reading and writing. The result is undefined if this flag is
 *   applied to a FIFO.
 *
 * Any combination of the following may be used
 *
 * %O_APPEND
 *   If set, the file offset shall be set to the end of the file prior to
 *   each write.
 * %O_CREAT
 *   If the file exists, this flag has no effect except as noted under
 *   %O_EXCL below. Otherwise, the file is created as a regular file; the
 *   user ID of the file shall be set to the effective user ID of the
 *   process; the group ID of the file shall be set to the group ID of the
 *   file's parent directory or to the effective group ID of the process;
 *   and the access permission bits of the file mode are set by the @mode
 *   argument modified by a bitwise AND with the umask of the process. This
 *   @mode argument does not affect whether the file is open for reading,
 *   writing, or for both.
 * %O_TRUNC
 *   If the file exists and is a regular file, and the file is successfully
 *   opened %O_RDWR or %O_WRONLY, its length is truncated to 0, and the
 *   mode and owner are unchanged. The result of using O_TRUNC without
 *   either %O_RDWR or %O_WRONLY is undefined.
 * %O_EXCL
 *   If %O_CREAT and %O_EXCL are set, mm_open() fails if the file exists.
 *   The check for the existence of the file and the creation of the file if
 *   it does not exist is atomic with respect to other threads executing
 *   mm_open() naming the same filename in the same directory with %O_EXCL
 *   and %O_CREAT set.
 *
 * Return: a non-negative integer representing the file descriptor in case
 * of success. Otherwise -1 is returned with error state set accordingly.
