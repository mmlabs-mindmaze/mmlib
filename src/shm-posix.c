 *
 * MM_MAP_SHARED
 *   Modifications to the mapped data are propagated to the underlying object.
 * MM_MAP_PRIVATE

 * with the file descriptor @fd which is not removed by a subsequent
 * mm_close() on that file descriptor. This reference will be removed when
 * there are no more mappings to the file.
 *
 * On windows platforms only, when mapping a file, the requested @size MUST
 * be lesser than or equal to the size of the file. Raise EOVERFLOW otherwise.
