/* Please name the version node according to the first 2 digit of version that
 * introduce the listed symbol within a soname.
 *
 * When SONAME bump is introduced, all symbols that are kept in the new version
 * must be grouped within the same version named after the version node using
 * the new soname.
 *
 * Example:
 * --------
 * The version of library "somelib" being compiled is currently 2.6.3. The
 * library exposes the following symbols:
 * - foo (introduced in 0.9.1)
 * - bar (introduced in 1.2.3)
 * - afunc (introduced in 2.0.0)
 * - bfunc (introduced in 2.3.1)
 *
 * The version script should be:
 *
 * SOMELIB_2.0 {
 *         global:
 *                 foo;
 *                 bar;
 *                 afunc;
 *         local: *;
 * };
 *
 * SOMELIB_2.3 {
 *         global:
 *                 bfunc;
 * } SOMELIB_2.0;
 *
